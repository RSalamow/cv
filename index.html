  <h3>Short introduction</h3>
  <p>
    I am solution oriented RPA professional with 3 years of experience. Especially expert on UiPath products
    such as UiPath Studio, UiPath Orchestrator and Document Understanding Framework. Developed and
    deployed 50+ RPA processes on production environment. Also I have strong software development
    background and experience so I can create my own packages and activities with C# .NET.

    Additionally intelligent document processing ability is my significant advantage as technology specialist.
    I created several data extraction processes using ABBYY Flexicapture. I have been actively using ABBYY
    products since 2019.

    Last to note for short, I have strong problem solving, analytical thinking abilities and proactive approach
    for potential problems according to my customers’ and managers’ feedback. With my communication
    skills I can build trust on my team and customers with time. Successfully managed several RPA projects
    that has many stakeholders such as IT, SMEs, project sponsor, third party providers, etc. with my
